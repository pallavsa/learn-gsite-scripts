<section>This lesson is designed to revise the alphabets we learned so far. In Assamese, there are few letters that are phonetically almost identical. We will review them as well.<br /><br /><h2>Same Sound Letters/Symbols:<br />
</h2><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3px" border="1" style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><th>Assamese Letters/Symbols</th><th>English Sound</th><th>Comments</th></tr><tr><td>ই, ঈ, ি, ী<br /></td><td>i as in `ink`<br /></td><td>Often we mistake and make distinction of ই vs. ঈ or ি vs. ী. However, in Assamese Phonetics, they actually have the same sound.<br /></td></tr><tr><td>ঋ, ৰি, ৃ<br /></td><td>Like &quot;re&quot; in `release`<br /></td><td>The sound of ঋ in Assamese is not as strong as it is in other Indian languages. So the sound almost resembles that of simple ৰি<br /></td></tr></tbody></table>
